# GeoQuest

## Run instructions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I am using pnpm in this project so ensure you have it installed by making sure you are using a nodejs version later than 16.17.0 and have set

```
corepack enable
```

Alternatively you can use npm just ensure that you do not commit the package-lock file

Then run

```
pnpm install
```

To install all the needed dependencies

```
pnpm build
```

To create a build of the project

```
pnpm start
```

To run the build after it has compiled successfully

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
